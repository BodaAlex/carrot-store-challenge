## How to start the REST server

Run the following commands:

- `npm install`
- `npm run start`
- go to `http://localhost:3000`

### Get all the products:
- GET http://localhost:3000/products

### Get single product:
- GET http://localhost:3000/product/{id}


## Requirement:

Fetch the content from the REST API server and display it in HTML instead of the static text for products and comments.
Use the fetch API: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API
